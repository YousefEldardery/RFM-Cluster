# 📊 RFM Clustering for Customer Segmentation

This project segments customers based on their purchasing behavior using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis combined with clustering techniques like K-Means. It helps businesses understand their customers better and create targeted marketing strategies to boost retention and sales.

## 📌 Project Goals

* Calculate RFM scores from transactional data.
* Normalize and preprocess RFM features for clustering.
* Apply clustering algorithms to identify distinct customer segments.
* Visualize and analyze the resulting clusters to gain insights.

## 🔍 Key Features

* Calculate **Recency** (days since last purchase), **Frequency** (number of purchases), and **Monetary** (total spend) per customer.
* Normalize and prepare RFM data for clustering.
* Use K-Means (or other algorithms) to segment customers into meaningful groups.
* Visualize clusters with scatter plots and heatmaps for easy interpretation.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas, NumPy
* Scikit-learn (clustering algorithms)
* Matplotlib, Seaborn (visualization)

## 🧠 Workflow Overview

* Load and clean transactional data.
* Calculate RFM metrics for each customer.
* Scale features and apply clustering algorithms.
* Analyze and visualize customer segments to understand behavior patterns.

## 📊 Sample Output

The script outputs cluster assignments and visualizations that highlight customer groups based on their purchase recency, frequency, and monetary value.

## 📌 To Do

* Add interactive dashboards for cluster exploration.
* Integrate other clustering methods and compare results.
* Provide actionable marketing recommendations per segment.
